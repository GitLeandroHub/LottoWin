# lottery_app

Lottery app is a mobile application developed using Flutter and Dart to demonstrate the difficulty of winning the jackpot in a draw-based lottery. Users must press on 7 numbers from 1 - 50 and then the chosen numbers will be compared to the winning numbers. If all 7 numbers match then the user wins the jackpot else they lose but, either way they are prompted to play again.
